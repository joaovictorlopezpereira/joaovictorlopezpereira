I'm a computer science student at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro with a strong interest in Functional Programming, Data
Structures and Scientific Computing.

<!---
Currently, I'm working on a scientific research project based on the
book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. Through this,
I've deepened my understanding of core programming concepts and
paradigms.

On this profile, you'll find both personal and collaborative
repositories, with most of my work centered around tools and concepts
in programming.

Feel free to explore!
